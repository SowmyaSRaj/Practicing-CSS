            Selector - indicate which element the rule applies to. the same rule
            can be applied to more than one element if you separate the element
            names with commas.

          <li>
            Declaration block - it is a set of css properties, indicates how the
            elements referred to in the selector should be styled. declarations
            are separated into two parts a property and a value, and are
            separated by a colon. multiple css declarations are separated with
            semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
          </li>
          <li>selector { property: value; }</li>
